      		  <h2>Contributions</h2>
      		  <p> Kolibri aims to be a sustainable, high-quality toolkit.
				  Contributions are validated through usability testing
				  and automated tests.
				  Industry experts and academic advisers assess the code quality
				  and the completeness of the documentation.
				  Every contribution must have proven its worth in an application.

			<h2>Live Test Cases</h2>
			<p>Have a look at the live <a href="./src/allTests.html">test case report</a>.
			</p>
			<p>Showing the report actually runs the latest test cases live in your current browser window.
			   The Kolibri test facility does not require any build steps or extra tooling.
			</p>

			<h2>A Live Tutorial from Examples</h2>
			<p>It is instructive to take a tour through the examples in order to understand how
				Kolibri helps with developing web applications. They are arranged from simple to
				increasingly complex and introduce new concepts along the way.
			</p>
			<p>Create a <a href="./src/examples/simpleForm/simpleFormView.html">simple form</a> very
				efficiently with just one line of code.
			</p>
			<p>Enforce and test <a href="./src/examples/workday/WorkingHours.html">business rules</a> in the UI
				to interactively manage working hours in a day.
			</p>
			<p>Put the daily work hours in a <a href="./src/examples/workweek/WorkingHours.html">week overview</a>
				and keep all the business rules in place by simply delegating to what we have done before.
				Show compositionality of controllers and projectors.
			</p>
			<p>Have some fun with multi-way editing in a
				<a href="./src/examples/person/MasterDetail.html">master-detail</a> view.
				It builds on what we already know and adds real interactive richness to our application.
			</p>
			<p>
				Wait for more to come here ...
			</p>

			<h2>Installation without dependency</h2>
			<p>Common wisdom has it that web development comes with a myriad of dependencies.
				Kolibri follows a different approach. We do not use any dependencies at all - neither
				at runtime nor at build-time. There actually is no build-time since we never need building.
			</p>
			<p>Likewise, a project that uses Kolibri should be able to follow the same
				approach and not even depend on Kolibri itself!
			</p>
			<p>We assume that you simply copy the Kolibri source code (everything under the
				src directory) into your own project. You become the owner of the copied code -
				just as if you copied it from stackoverflow.
			</p>
			<p>This copy includes the documentation, examples, the testing facility, and the test cases.
				It will likely contain more than you need for your production code but that does no harm.
				Kolibri is fully written as ES6 modules, which means that you can "treeshake" with any bundler
				to remove all unused parts from your own production bundle while still having all the best
				developer experience when programming.
			</p>
			<p>For the die-hard "but I just want to have Kolibri as a single file" developers, there is a
				<a href="./production/productionBundle.js">production bundle</a> that always reflects the
				latest version (see <a href="./src/kolibri/version.js">version</a>). It contains the
				jsdoc but neither the test cases nor the examples.
				This might be useful for quick experiments.
